npm i prop-types@15.6.2

Component.propTypes = {

id:PropTypes.number,
name:PropTypes.string
}
///it is to assign default value to props
const {textProperty,value} = this.props;

Component.defaultProps = {
textProperty:"name",
value :"_id"
}


=======

npm i react-router-dom@4.3.1

import BrowserRouter from 'react-router-dom'
we need to wrap the App.js with BrowserRouter
<BrowserRouter>
<App/>
</BrowserRouter>
this (BrowserRouter) component wraps the history object in browser and passes it down to the component tree.
Any where in the compont tree we wil be able to use the history object.

===
import {Router } from 'react-router-dom'
<Route path = "/home" exact component = ""/>
<Route path = "/contacts/:id/:name" exact component = ""/>
<Route path = "/admin/:id?" exact component = ""/>
<Route path = "/" exact component = ""/>  ? means optional parameter
Route component is a wrapper around the component we had in Route tag and it will automatically injects three properties called history location match.

Switch renders the first matched component from the routes.
Exact :It renders the exact matched component
with swith ,excat no longer required

<Link to "/admin">Admin</Link>
with link we can acheive single page application and we can avoid reloading the browser refresh on each click of router.
All aour components are downoladed and placed in bundle.js ahead of time whwn the application loads for the first time.

-==========
use render method if we want to pass props in router
<Route path = "contact" render ={(props)=> <Contact id ={id} {...props}/>}/>
adding props will enable us to use history match location

=============Query Params=====

to read the query params install below

npm install query-string@6.1.0

usage==> 
import queryString from 'query-string'
const posts = ({match,history,location}) => {
const queryParams = queryString.parse(location.search);

}

======Redirecting====
import {Redirect } from 'react-router-dom'

<Route path = "/home" exact component = ""/>
<Route path = "/contacts/:id/:name" exact component = ""/>
<Route path = "/admin/:id?" exact component = ""/>
<Route path = "/not-found" component = "NotFound" />
<Redirect from = "/users" to = "/userList" /> ===> if path matches to users redirect to userList 
<Route path = "/" exact component = ""/>  ? means optional parameter
<Redirect to = "/not-found" /> ---if path doesnt matches redirect to not found

====Push n replace ==
push n replace availabe in history object 
this.props.history.push('/products')----if we click back iy will go back to prev page
this.props.history.replace('/products')--this will anot allow user to go back
